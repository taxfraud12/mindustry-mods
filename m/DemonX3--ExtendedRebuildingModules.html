<h1>ExtendedRebuildingModules</h1>
<p>This mod aims to add more playable ships and mechs with different specializations.<br />
Currently the mod supports 3 new ships and 1 new mech to chose from:</p>
<p>Sister Ship<br />
Alternative construction ship model which trades damage for ability to heal buildings.
Unlike Tau Class Mech, Sister Class Ship has advantage in mobility, although lacks durability and battle capabilities.<br />
Weapon: Structural Projector<br />
Weapon damage: 7<br />
<em>Weapon healing: 2%<br />
</em>Heal Based Weapon<br />
Health: 175<br />
Mine speed: 125%<br />
Drillpower: 100%<br />
Buildpower: 100%<br />
Storage: 26</p>
<p>Stalker Mech<br />
Heavily armored close combat specialised mech. Stalker is equipped with dual proton pulsators that shoot in bursts of protonic charges, 
dealing massive damage at close range. Stalkers cannot be manufactured on the surface, 
so they are constructed on mothership and are sent to the drop points on request. 
Please do not toss them at enemies' meltdowns and spectres, Stalkers are quite expensive.<br />
Weapon: Proton Pulsators<br />
Weapon damage: 16<br />
<em>Weapon shots: 14<br />
</em>Shotgun Based Weapon<br />
Health: 600<br />
Mine speed: 150%<br />
Drillpower: 100%<br />
Buildpower: 90%<br />
Storage: 48  </p>
<p>Reaver Ship<br />
Heavy assault gunship, designed for air-ground support actions. 
Armed with heavy A100 minigun at the cost of weak construction and mining projectors. 
While 'Reaver' is gunship's official name, people often call it 'Black Pearl' or 'Flying Dutchman'. 
And now this ship is literally associated with legends of space pirates.<br />
Weapon: A100<br />
Weapon damage: 14<br />
Health: 1250<br />
Mine speed: 50%<br />
Drillpower: 100%<br />
Buildpower: 50%<br />
Storage: 120  </p>
<p><strong>Yamato Battlecruiser<br />
510 years of inhuman experiments on a Meltdown turrets led us to this pinnacle of spacecraft. 
Armed with amplified version of Meltdown, that does not overheat, comes with pre-installed internal impact reactor 
that fuels the Meltdown onboard. And best part is that this abomination can actually move!<br />
<em>Weapon: Meltdown<br />
</em>Exactly<br />
Health: 5000<br />
Mine speed: 0%<br />
Drillpower: 0%<br />
Buildpower: 100%<br />
Storage: 600<br />
</strong>In the near future will be either removed from the mod or fully reworked in favor of a unigue weapon and ability, rather then meltdown.  </p>
<p>V1.3 coming soon:
- New Mech
- New Ship
- Yamato rework</p>
<p>V1.2 strikes:
- Reaver ship was resprited
- Minor balance tweaks
- Mech weapon is now specified in the database</p>
<p>V1.1:<br />
- Mod updated to the newest build 100<br />
- Added russian localisation | Добавлена русская локализация.<br />
- Buffed Sister attackspeed, raising her combat and healing capabilities while not making them utter good.<br />
- Lowered build cost for Sister Ship Pad - Updated sprites for Yamato Construction Facility(Meltdown Ship Pad) and Reaver bullets.<br />
- Reaver weapon rework. Raised bullet velocity, no longer keeps ship velocity.<br />
- Yamato weapon rework. Behaves like real meltdown beam, holding itself. When ship is idle, beam will start sweeping in an arc.<br />
- I finally figured out how github works.  </p>
