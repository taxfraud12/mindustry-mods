<h1>Elementary</h1>
<p>A mod for mindustry that adds more elements including iron, aluminium, lithium, and more!</p>
<h2>Newest Update: V0.6</h2>
<p>New things:
- Updated texture for induction smelter, sifter, and bismuth.
- 2 new Sniper style turrets, Shine and Glare.
- New power generator, the surge generator.
- New 1X1 tile drill.
- Cryofluid Makers now use lithium also.
- Several build costs have been modified.</p>
<h2>All feautures added by this mod</h2>
<h3>Items:</h3>
<p>Iron:
- Similar to copper, used for some construction.</p>
<p>Steel:
- A strong alloy used in the construction of many blocks.</p>
<p>Lithium:
- A reactive weak metal used for batteries and making coolant.</p>
<p>Bismuth:
- A slightly radioactive material that can be turned into thorium.</p>
<p>Bauxite:
- An ore of aluminium, but be refined before it is useful.</p>
<p>Aluminium:
- A lightweight metal used for aerial drones and for larger walls.</p>
<p>Bronze:
- An alloy which can be used as ammo, or to make special drones.</p>
<h2>Liquids:</h2>
<p>Molten Bismuth:
- Bismuth that's been heated to high temperatures.</p>
<p>Muddy Water:
- Sand suspended in water.</p>
<h2>New Blocks:</h2>
<p>Steel Walls:
- Has a large and small variant, health is comparable to titanium.</p>
<p>Aluminium Walls:
- Has a large and small variant, which are 4x4 and 2x2 respectively.</p>
<p>Lithium Battery:
- A battery with a very large capacity, 200,000 power units.</p>
<p>Surge Generator:
- Generates power from surge alloy 0.5 surge per sec &gt; 600 power per sec.</p>
<p>Shine:
- A turret that shoots copper or bronze at very long distances, has moderate damage and slow reload time.</p>
<p>Glare:
- A turret that shoots copper, bronze, or thorium at very long distances, with a  faster reload time.</p>
<p>Small Drill:
- A 1x1 size drill that can mine titanium.</p>
<p>Lithium Filterer:
- Filters lithum out of water, 12 water &gt; 1 lithium.</p>
<p>Mixer:
- Mixes water with sand to make muddy water, 2 sand + 1 water &gt; 1 muddy water.</p>
<p>Sifter:
- Sifts muddy water to produce iron, titanium, or (more rarely) bismuth.</p>
<p>Induction Smelter:
- Smelts iron and coal together to make steel, 2 iron + 1 coal &gt; 2 steel.</p>
<p>Bauxite Refiner:
- Refines bauxite into aluminium, 4 bauxite &gt; 1 aluminium.</p>
<p>Bronze Alloyer:
- Melts copper and aluminium together to make bronze, 4 copper + 1 aluminium &gt; 5 bronze.</p>
<p>Bismuth Crucible:
- Melts bismuth, 1 bismuth &gt; 7 molten bismuth.</p>
<p>Irradiator:
- Irradiates molten bismuth to make thorium, 12 molten bismuth &gt; 1 thorium.</p>
<p>Banshee Factory:
- Produces banshee miner drones, 50 silicon + 60 bronze + 20 aluminium &gt; 1 banshee.</p>
<h2>Units:</h2>
<p>Banshee:
- An advanced miner unit that can mine titanium.</p>
<h2>Modified Blocks</h2>
<p>Duo + Salvo:
- Can now use bronze as ammo.</p>
<p>Wave:
- Can now use muddy water and molten bismuth as ammo.</p>
<p>Cryofluid Mixer:
- Requires lithium and titanium to make cryofluid.</p>
<p>Phantom, Wraith, Ghoul, Revenant Factories:
- Requires aluminium instead of titanium to make drones.</p>
<p>Several other blocks have also been modified to require steel to build.</p>
<h2>Modified Units</h2>
<p>Draug:
- Will now mine copper, lead, and titanium.</p>
