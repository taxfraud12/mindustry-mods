<p>I have uploaded this to the steam workshop and i can indeed update it when i please, </p>
</li>
<li>I will be updating here but its kind of delayed, </li>
<li>If you have the steam version check https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903525208
because you get automatic updates whenever i update the mod, also its easier for me and its faster too.
