<h1>Diamond-Ore</h1>
<p>Adds the Diamond resource, as well as various structures which utilize it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diamonds require an Airblast Drill or better to be mined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Structures:</p>
<p>Diamond Drill - Extremely rapid drill that can mine anything extractable.</p>
<p>Precision Diamond Drill - Extremely rapid drill that can mine anything extractable. Only occupies one tile.</p>
<p>Diamond Turret - Comes in two sizes, and accepts a variety of ammo types.</p>
<p>Barrage Turret - Short range high damage rapidfire turret.</p>
<p>Epsilon Ship Pad - Transform your mech into a slow but durable resource transport and mining vehicle.</p>
<p>Mortar Mech Pad - Transform your mech into a long-range artillery mech.</p>
<p>Tempest Mech Pad - Transform your mech into a large slow mech that fires balls of plasma.</p>
<p>Beelzebub Swarm Drone Factory - builds cheap fast drones that are weak but hard to hit. Each factory can spawn up to ten drones.</p>
<p>Grenader Factory - builds grenade-firing ground units.</p>
<p>Firefly Factory - builds highly volatile air units.</p>
<p>Reaver Factory - builds fast ground-based missile units.</p>
<p>Hunter Factory - builds heavy ground-based shotgun units.</p>
<p>Taser Factory - builds slow but very powerful lightning-shooting air units.</p>
<p>Diamond Synthesizer - Fueled by slag, it uses large amounts of coal to synthesize a diamond that's identical to natural diamonds down to chemical composition.</p>
<p>Cryogem Compressor - uses power to turn cryofluid into solid chunks you can launch with your core.</p>
<p>Cryogem Dissipator - uses power to turn cryogems back into cryofluid for use in cooling turrets or thorium reactors.</p>
<p>Diamond Wall - Comes in four sizes; can take seriously large amounts of punishment, especially the Huge and Gigantic sizes.</p>
<p>Diamond Solar Panel - A much stronger solar panel.</p>
<p>Diamond Vault - A durable storage block.</p>
<p>Mass Distributer - A larger router.</p>
<p>Aqua Drill - A compact water extractor</p>
<p>Reinforced Battery - 2x2 block that combines 4 regular batteries into one durable block.</p>
<p>Reinforced Liquid Tank - 5x5 block with a much larger liquid capacity.</p>
<p>Reinforced Power Distributor - 3x3 Power node with a range of 50 blocks. Its insulated plating makes automatic connection impossible.</p>
<p>Surge Reactor - 6x6 power generator block fueled by surge alloy. Very unstable and requires lots of cryofluid to operate safely...</p>
<p>Crystal Conveyor - Better conveyor with more health and speed. Possesses an armored dome above it that blocks ground unit movement.</p>
<p>Thor Turret - A late-game missile turret</p>
<p>Odin Turret - A late-game anti-air turret</p>
<p>Loki Turret - A late-game anti-ground turret</p>
<p>Pyra-Smelter - A late-game Silicon Smelter</p>
<p>Cryo-Separator - A late-game Separator that can output any vanilla resource in the game. *Phase fabric is stupidly rare though</p>
<p>Multi-Compressor - A late-game Plastanium Compressor</p>
<p>Multi-Pyra Mixer - A late-game Pyratite Mixer</p>
<p>Blast Compound Multi-Mixer - A late-game Blast Mixer</p>
