<h1>Mindustry+</h1>
<p>A mod that brings new items, buildings weapon amunition and more into the game!</p>
<p>Designed and created by BurritoAlpaca and Arkanic on github.com</p>
<p>Please note:
This mod is currently being updated very frequently and this obviously makes it a bit unstable, if something isn't working then just write up an issue or something and ill be sure to fix it, if I'm halfway through something I will either make sure that it is functioning or I will disable that block/thing for the time being so that there is always a working version online within an absolute maximum of 4 hours.</p>
<p>Am back to making regular updates and changes so look out for more in the future!</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
